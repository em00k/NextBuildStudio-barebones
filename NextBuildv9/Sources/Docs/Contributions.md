## 🎯 **The Heavy Lifters**

<div class="credit-card">

### 🧠 **ZX Basic Compiler** by José Rodríguez (boriel)

**Without this, NextBuild is just a fancy text editor**

José's ZX Basic compiler is what actually does all the hard work:
- 🚀 Turns your BASIC into lightning-fast Z80 code
- 📚 Massive library of functions ready to use
- 🎯 Works on 48K, 128K, and Next
- 🔧 Mix BASIC and assembly when you need to get dirty
- 📦 So flexible, it makes bananas look straight

### 🎮 **CSpect Emulator** by Mike Dailly

- 🔬 Top Notch Debugging tools (breakpoints, memory viewer, the works)
- 🎨 Hardware emulation so accurate it's scary
- 🚀 Runs fast enough to actually enjoy your games
- 🛠️ Built by a dev, for devs

## 🏆 **The Guy Who Puts It All Together**

<div class="credit-card">

### 🎖️ **David Saphier (em00k)**
*The one holding this mess together*

Just a guy who got tired of switching between 15 different tools to make a simple Next game.

- 🛠️ **Started:** 2018 (feels like forever ago)
- 🎯 **Goal:** Stop making Next development such a pain
- 🌟 **Reality:** It's still kind of a pain, but less pain

</div>

---

<div class="note">
🙏 <strong>Thanks!</strong><br>
The Next community is pretty awesome. Everyone helps everyone, shares code, and nobody gets too grumpy when I break things.

<em>We're all just trying to make cool games on a computer from 2017 that thinks it's from 1982. 🤷‍♂️</em>
