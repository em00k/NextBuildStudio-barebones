Welcome to **NextBuild Studio (NBS)** — everything you need to make brilliant **ZX Spectrum Next** games and apps without going completely mad.

Built around the brilliant [**Boriel ZX Basic Compiler**](https://github.com/boriel-basic/zxbasic) by [boriel](https://zxbasic.readthedocs.io/en/docs/), NBS adds proper Next hardware support so you can actually use all the fancy new features:

Make sure you check out the `tutorials` on [**NextBuilds Home**](https://zxnext.uk/nextbuildstudio)

- 🕹️ Edit Sprites with `.spr`, `.til`, `.fnt` support  
- 🎵 Sampled sound, PT3 music, SFX playback  
- 🎨 Full 256-colour support, DMA & Copper effects  
- 💻 Proper integrated development with hover-help and inline docs  
- ⚡ One-click compile & run with CSpect  
- 🧠 Real-time syntax checks and auto-snippets

---

## 🛠️ How This All Works

NextBuild Studio is built with Codium, so if you've used Visual Studio Code before, you'll feel right at home! On the left you've got the `Explorer` view for navigating your `workspace` (basically just the folder with all your files in). When **NBS** starts up, it'll be looking at your `Documents\NextBuildv9\` folder. 

The tabs at the top show your open files. 


## ``Important!``
If you wander off and want to get back to this page, just **right-click** the `ReadMe.md` in the `Explorer` and choose **Open Preview**

When you open a `.bas` file, you can then use `F1` to open the inline help system.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

In NBS, you edit `.bas` files and build them with the **Compile** button (bottom bar) or just press `F5`.

Give it a go:
- Click on [**holymoley.bas**](./NextBuild_Examples/GAMES/HoleyMoley/holeymoley.bas)  
- Then click **Compile**, press `F7 → Build Source` or `F5` to Complile & Run.
- It'll build and fire up CSpect automatically!

The **Explorer** will open the folder on the left. Have a poke around with the inline docs and hover-help — press **F1** for more details!

## 🛠️ Built-in Tools

- 🧱 **Sprite Editor** (`.spr`, `.til`, `.fnt`, `.nxm`)
- 🗺️ **Map Editor** (`.nxm`)
- 🖼️ **Image Importer** (sprites, panels, convert images)
- 🧩 **Block Editor** (composite sprite editing)
- 🔍 **Image Viewer** (`.nxi`, `.sl2`)
- 📘 **Inline Help** and ZX Basic Docs (F1)
- ✅ **Syntax Checker**, **Snippets**, and **Templates**
- 🔊 **PT3 Player** (Windows only) - Right-click a ```.pt3``` file in the explorer to play, ```Esc``` to quit
- 🎹 **AYFX editor** ``Ctrl+Shift+P``, type ``"AYFX"``
- 🚦More commands available in the **Command Palette** ```ctrl+shift+p``` and type ```NextBuild```
