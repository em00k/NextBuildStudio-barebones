### Analyzing and Deduplicating Sprites
The extension provides tools to find and remove duplicate sprites in your sprite files:

1. **From the Sprite Editor**: 
   - Open a sprite file in the sprite viewer
   - Click the "Analyze Duplicates" button in the toolbar
   - Review the report in the output panel
   - Optionally highlight duplicates in the editor
   - Save a deduplicated version if desired

2. **From Explorer**:
   - Right-click on a sprite file (.spr, .til, .fnt, etc.)
   - Select "NextBuild: Analyze Sprite Duplicates"
   - Follow the prompts

3. **From Block/Map Editor**:
   - Open a block (.nxb) or map (.nxm) file in the block viewer
   - Make sure a sprite file is loaded
   - Click the "Analyze Duplicates" button in the toolbar
   - Review the report in the output panel
   - Choose whether to update the block/map references when saving the deduplicated sprite file

When you analyze duplicates, the extension will:
- Find exact matches as well as flipped and rotated sprites (configurable)
- Generate a detailed report with potential space savings
- Optionally save a deduplicated sprite file 
- Optionally update block/map files to reference the new sprite indices

This maintains the visual appearance of your blocks and maps while reducing sprite data size.

## ZX Next File Formats

### Palette Format
ZX Next palette files use a 9-bit RGB format (3 bits per color component). Each color entry takes 2 bytes:
- Byte 1: `RRRGGGBB`
- Byte 2: `-------B` (only the least significant bit is used)

This gives a total of 512 possible colors (8 levels per RGB component).

### Sprite Formats
The ZX Next supports multiple sprite formats:

1. **8-bit Sprites**: 16×16 pixel images using 8-bits for each pixel (256 colors). Each sprite requires 256 bytes.
2. **4-bit Sprites**: 16×16 pixel images using 4-bits for each pixel (16 colors). Each sprite requires 128 bytes.
3. **8×8 Font Characters**: Similar to sprites but in 8×8 format with 256 colors.
4. **Tiles**: 8×8 pixel images using 4-bits per pixel (16 colors).

### Map and Block Format
Maps reference a collection of blocks. Each block is an 8×8 arrangement of tiles with attribute data.

### Optimized Block Format
The optimized block format (.oxb) is a more efficient way to store blocks for ZX Next development:
- Only stores non-empty sprites within blocks, saving memory
- Preserves original block dimensions and structure
- Stores sprite positions (x,y) and sprite indices for each non-empty sprite
- Useful for games and applications where memory efficiency is important
- Traditional blocks store all sprites in a block (including empty ones)
- Optimized blocks only store the sprite data that's actually visible

#### Technical Details of .oxb Format
The binary structure of the optimized block format is as follows:

**Header (7 bytes)**:
- Bytes 0-1: Magic number "OB" (Optimized Blocks)
- Byte 2: Version (currently 1)
- Byte 3: Original block width in sprites
- Byte 4: Original block height in sprites
- Bytes 5-6: Number of blocks (little-endian)

**For each block**:
- Byte 0: Number of sprite positions in this block
- For each sprite position:
  - Byte 0: X position (offset from block origin)
  - Byte 1: Y position (offset from block origin)
  - Byte 2: Sprite index

**Size Comparison**:
- Traditional block format: Block count × (width × height) bytes
- Optimized block format: 7 + Block count × (1 + visible sprites × 3) bytes

For example, a map with 100 blocks, each 2×2 sprites, with an average of 2 non-empty sprites per block:
- Traditional format: 100 × (2 × 2) = 400 bytes
- Optimized format: 7 + 100 × (1 + 2 × 3) = 707 bytes

However, if the blocks have more empty space:
- For the same 100 blocks with an average of 1 non-empty sprite per block:
  - Traditional format: 400 bytes
  - Optimized format: 7 + 100 × (1 + 1 × 3) = 407 bytes

The optimized format becomes more efficient as the blocks contain more empty space or when the blocks are larger (like 4×4 or 8×8).

### Image Formats
- .nxi files are ZX Next image files
- .sl2 and .sll are layer files (screen layers)

## Creating Test Files

You can use the included PowerShell scripts to create test files:

### Palette Files
```powershell
./create-test-palette.ps1  # Creates test.pal
./create-test-nxp.ps1      # Creates test.nxp
```

### Sprite Files
```powershell
./create-test-sprite.ps1   # Creates test-8bit.spr, test-4bit.spr, test-font.spr, and test.til
```

### Block and Map Files
```powershell
./create-test-block.ps1    # Creates test.nxb
./create-test-map.ps1      # Creates test.nxm
```
